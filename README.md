# ðŸ¤– Sign Language Decoder

A **Streamlit-based web app** that uses **YOLOv8** for recognizing letters from **sign language gestures**. Users can upload images or videos, or use their webcam to detect hand signs in real-time. The app also provides audio feedback for detected letters.

> âš¡ This project is a customized version of the original work by [Mariam Gamal](https://github.com/Mariam111) with additional modifications and simplifications.
